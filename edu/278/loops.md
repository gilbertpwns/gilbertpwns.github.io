# Loops

## 4.3.3

Loops are commonly used to process an input list of values. A **sentinel value** is a special value indicating the end of a list, such as a list of positive integers ending with 0, as in 10 1 6 3 0. The example below computes the average of an input list of positive integers, ending with 0. The 0 is not included in the average.

## 4.5.5

Programs are sometimes used to auto-generate data tables. The following program generates a table of Celsius and Fahrenheit temperature values, in increments of 5 C. The loop counts from -10 to 40 in increments of 5, and names the loop variable currC rather than i to be more descriptive.
