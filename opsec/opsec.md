* payload FUD (fully undetectable)
* spreading your payload
* profiting rom installs (monetization)
* staying anonymous

## getting started

making a goal. for a setup, find a good RAT/Loader malware that suits your need, my personal setup goes some like:

RATs are the main payload for it's many persistence features that allow you to keep your bots alive for longer times, then use the auto task feature to execute a UAC bypass of mine that after executes a slient miner. the reason for the UAC bypass is to bypass the administrator rights permission prompt that is required by my miner's setting to work. i personally  mine RVN with GPU and XMR with CPU.

the reason you should spread a loader or a RAT with remote file exectuion features is that having post-infection control on your bots essential, for example, you don't want to be spreading a silent miner alone, because you will not have the opportunity to maximize the profit from these installs post-excution.

if you choose to go for a loader

## payload FUD (fully undetectable)

landing pages are websites which exist with the sole purpose of spreading malware. landing pages need to generate traffic and SEO could assist in such, Google Ads and Youtube are popular selections.

most landing pages use workpress, and are pretty much the meta in spreading due to them spreading your payload the most once enough traffic is generated
