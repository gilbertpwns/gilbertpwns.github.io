# [Learning Process](./#)

We do not need to learn every programming language to understand how to read their code. All of them follow the same principles which R. D. Tennent initially defined:

* The Principle of Abstraction
* The Principle of Correspondence
* The Principle of Data Type Completeness

Occam's Razor is one of the central principles of modern scientific theory. The principle is based on the following definition:

The most straightforward theory is preferable to all others of several sufficient possible explanations for the same state of facts. In other words: The simplest explanation is always the most probable.

What do we already know?
What do we not know yet?

## The Will

In psychology, will is considered a descriptive construct that presupposes a conscious decision to act, and thus, it is primarily associated with rational action.

Will is used in different contexts and has several meanings: the mental act from which an impulse to achieve specific goals emanates and the setting of goals, and the ultimate translation of these personally or collectively made decisions into action, that is, into conscious and deliberate or even planned action.

*Fear is a state and the product of our imagination of the future and its consequences where the present is suppressed.*

Fear is essential and healthy in life-threatening and health-threatening situations. However, sitting in a chair in front of a computer afraid of not being up to the tasks we find here, is irrational. After all, we have not yet worked through most of the material, but we are already beginning to program (adjust) ourselves to fail. So let's ask if this fear is real:

* have we already worked through all the material?
* have we already seen what is being taught and how it is being taught?
* do we already have the skills that are expected of us?

## The Goal

The results of a meta-analysis of over 200 studies with more than 40,000 participants show that over 90 percent of people are significantly more successful in achieving their dreams **by setting challenging and specific goals**.

In short, no matter what the goal is: we must decide on it.
