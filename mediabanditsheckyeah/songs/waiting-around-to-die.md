```
[Verse 1]
Sometimes, I don't know where this dirty road is taking me
Sometimes, I don't even know the reason why
But I guess I keep a-gamblin', lots of booze, and lots of ramblin'
Well, it's easier than just a-waitin' around to die

[Verse 2]
At one time, friends, I had a ma, I even had a pa
Well he beat her with a belt once 'cause she cried
She told him to take care of me, headed down to Tennessee
Well, it's easier than just a-waitin' around to die

[Verse 3]
I came of age and I found a girl in a Tuscaloosa bar
Ah, she cleaned me out and hit it on the sly
Well, I tried to kill the pain, I bought some wine and hopped a train
It seemed easier than just a-waitin' around to die

[Verse 4]
Then, a friend said he knew where some easy money was
We robbed a man, and, brother, did we fly
But the posse caught up with me and drug me back to Muskogee
And it's two long years a-waitin' around to die

[Verse 5]
Ah, but now, I'm out of prison, I got me a friend at last
He don't drink or steal or cheat or lie
Ah his name is Codeine, he's the nicest thing I've seen
Well, together, we're gonna wait around and die
Yeah, together, we're gonna wait around and die
