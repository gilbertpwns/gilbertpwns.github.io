# Introduction to Brute Forcing

## What is Brute-Forcing?

A trial-and-error method used to crack passwords, login credentials, or encryption keys by systematically trying every possible combination of characters.

## Factors Influencing Brute Force Attacks

* complexity of the password or key
* computational power available to the attacker
* security measures

## How Brute Forcing Works

### Start

The attacker initiates the brute force process.

### Generate Possible Combination

The software generates a potential password or key combination.

### Apply Combination

The generated combination is attempted against the target system

### Check if Successful

The system evaluates the attempted combination

### Access Granted (if successful)

The attacker gains unauthorized

### End (if unsuccessful)

 The process repeats until the correct combination is found or the attacker gives up.
